qualudes,"A popular recreational drug of the 60s and 70s.  Quaaludes (Methaqualone) are a group of CNS depressants classed as ""hypnotic sedatives"" with a similar effect to alcohol.  Effects are sedation, decrease in anxiety, loosening of inhibitions, and loss of balance. Some people experience pleasant body effects. Side effects include disorientation, extreme sedation/sleep, grogginess the next day, and memory loss. One should be careful not to combine quaaludes or benzodiazepines with alcohol or other CNS depressants (opiates, ghb, etc). They are synergistic drugs and can greatly amplify the effects and side effects of each drug, and cause extreme illnes and possibly death. The manufacture of quaaludes was ceased in the early 80s due to drug abuse.\n> Doctors used to prescribe qualudes for anxiety.\n",

Queef Cordon Bleu,"During WWII French women would stuff their vaginas with cheese and queef to avoid being raped by Nazi soldiers during village invasions. So offensive was the smell of these queefs that the Nazi’s would avoid these villages entirely; often returning to base in need of medical treatment similar to that required by victims of napalm. Due to the scarceness of food during those times the cheese could not be wasted. In the absence of a chicken the most popular way to enjoy Queef Cordon Bleu was for the whole family to gather around Mum’s vagina with their bread sticks. Every one would enjoy dipping their bread in the cheese and Mum would get a little extra kick for her hard work.\n> I’m sorry I can’t play with you after school today Peire, but mother has been baking a batch of Queef Cordon Bleu for her last 3 menstrual cycles.

queerplatonic,"Adjective describing a relationship which is more intense and intimate than is considered common or normal for a ""[friendship]"", but doesn't fit the traditional sexual-romantic couple model. It is characterized by a strong bond, love, and emotional commitment, yet is not perceived by those involved as ""romantic"". The relationship may or may not have some elements or degree of sexuality/eroticism at various times, or none - it doesn't matter, because sexuality/sexual exclusivity is not what the relationship is organized around. It's defined by the intensity and significance of the emotional connection.\n\nThe people involved do not have to identify as ""[queer]"", it's a type of relationship experienced by and available to anybody regardless of their [sexual orientation], [romantic orientation], or (non-)monogamy. The people involved in a queerplatonic relationship may consider themselves partners, life-partners, a couple, a triad, or any other term that implies the relationship is meaningful, committed and intimate.\n\nQuuerplatonic parters or QPs are sometimes referred to as ""zucchini"". As in, ""he's my zucchini"". This was originally a joke within the [asexual]/[aromantic] community, underscoring the lack of words in mainstream relationship discourse to signify meaningful relationships that do not follow the standard and expected sexual/romantic norms, and frustration with the erasure of other kinds of intimacy, which were perceived as equally valuable to the sexual/romantic model.\n> The reason that i was uncomfortable with the word 'girlfriend' was that i did not want a romantic relationship and the word seemed to imply one: I think what I may have wanted was a queerplatonic relationship.\n> I never understood why people were so opposed to affection of any kind towards people that are not dating, I think the world would be better if everybody could cuddle and it was not weird (kind of like how it used to be in Abe Lincoln's time when it was normal for men to sleep in the same bed together as a strictly platonic thing or like queerplatonic relationships maybe).\n> They told their friend about queerplatonic partnerships the same day they asked their friend if they could be queerplatonic partners, and they said yes.\n",

quote unquote,"A horribly incorrect way of citing a particular phrase or adding emphasis to a questionable term. Typically it preceeds the phrase and is accompanied by a stupid little fang finger gesture. If you currently use the term ""quote unquote"" (and especially if you do the finger thing) please stop it now. Don't feel bad. It's an understandable mistake because the idiots on Fox News say it all the time as does your boss at work, most probably. But read on...\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it should be QUOTE and ENDQUOTE. These are the official names for the double apostrophe symbols ("") on your keyboard.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the proper syntax is to say QUOTE, followed by the phrase, closed by ENDQUOTE.\r\n\r\nCORRECT USAGE (spoken):\r\nWhat do you think of Bush's quote War on Terror endquote?\r\n\r\nmeans:\r\nWhat do you think of Bush's ""War on Terror?""\r\n\r\nINCORRECT USAGE (spoken):\r\nWhat do you think of Bush's quote unquote War on Terror?\r\n\r\nmeans:\r\nWhat do you think of Bush's """"War on Terror?\r\n\r\nGet it? Good. But try to avoid saying it altogether. Using the phrase ""so-called"" is much more acceptable. Example:\r\nWhat do you think of Bush's so-called War on Terror?\n> (Incorrect but common usage)\n> BOSS: Ok people, let's get proactive. This is a win-win situation. So give it 110% and quote unquote kick some ass!\n> EMPLOYEE: Man, you're such a putz.\n",

qwop,"QWOP is a simple flash game where kids can play, laugh and have fun with while learning the basics about the body and what it is capable of. It's very educating, and it'll make children understand how to run properly when they grow older.\n\nWe suggest parents to show this wonderful game to any little girl or boy they may think might want to run the Olympics someday.\n\nThe name ""QWOP"" is from the fact that you only need the keyboard letters Q, W, O and P to play.\n\n(Note: The author of this post has been taking lithium after going in complete depression after playing QWOP. Side effects to this game may not vary. All reactions have been proven the same: an urge to hit a baby, having blue vision, eating their own shit, having uncontrollable periods {both male and female}, listening to static in a bright red room and/or randomly yelling at their neighbor's wall asking for a Twinkie. See a doctor if any child has these symptoms or if they start having other strange behavior after one minute of playing this flash game.)\n> QWOP is a game Chuck Norris can't even win.\n",
